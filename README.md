BrightTV Viewership Analytics & Growth Strategy
Project Overview
This project analyzes user and viewership data for BrightTV. The primary objective is to derive actionable insights to support the Customer Value Management (CVM) team in achieving the financial year's goal of growing the company's subscription base.

The analysis will focus on understanding user behavior, consumption patterns, and the factors that influence viewership. The final output will be a 20-minute presentation summarizing the findings and providing data-driven recommendations.

Key Objectives & Questions
The analysis will address the following key topics as requested by the CEO:

User and Usage Trends: Provide detailed insights into the trends observed in BrightTV's user profiles and their platform usage.

Consumption Drivers: Identify and analyze the factors that influence content consumption among subscribers.

Content Strategy: Recommend specific content types to boost consumption on days that typically show low viewership.

Growth Initiatives: Propose strategic initiatives designed to further expand BrightTV's user base.

Dataset & Technical Notes
The analysis is based on a dataset containing user profiles and viewer transaction data for BrightTV.

Important Considerations:

Timezone Conversion: All date and time data in the dataset is provided in UTC and must be converted to South African Standard Time (SAST) for accurate analysis.

Data Structure: Consumption data is recorded per session. This means each record in the dataset represents a single viewing session for a subscriber.

External Data: The use of additional external data is permitted to enrich the analysis and presentation.

deliverables
The final deliverable is a 20-minute presentation that synthesizes the analytical findings and presents clear, actionable recommendations to the CVM team and stakeholders.
